Once your full node is up and running, you need to apply 
it to make it eligible as a masternode.

[This page](/masternode/run-node/) shows a tutorial for beginners to run a full node.

## Getting sufficient DIR
As 25'000 (25k) DIR are required to apply: 

* If you plan to run your node on testnet, you need to to get 25k DIR for testnet.

Our team will then review your request and send you the required funds.

*Note: Those testnet DIR are only usable in testnet, they have absolutely no trading value*

* If you plan to run your node on mainnet, you need to acquire at least 25k DIR on 
exchanges/token sales that list DIR or during the token sale period.

## Applying to become a masternode
You can now apply by going to the DioraMaster page for 
[testnet](coming soon)
Login with the wallet that contains your newly received 25k DIR.

On the top right corner, click on "Become a Candidate".

Enter the amount of DIR you want to deposit (minimum 25k).

Enter your coinbase address. This is the public key of the account that your masternode is using.

Confirm with apply and proceed to make the payement.

Your full node will now be listed on DioraMaster.
People can view its details and vote for it.

If your node is in the top 150 most voted nodes, it will be promoted 
as a masternode and will start producing blocks at the next epoch.

## Resigning your masternode
In case you want to stop your node, you need to resign it from DioraMaster first 
in order to retrieve your locked funds.
Access DioraMaster, go to your candidate detail page, 
and click the `Resign` button.
Your funds will be available to withdraw 1440 epochs (around 30 days) after the resignation.

At this point, your masternode is completly terminated.
