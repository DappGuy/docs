# Staking / Voting



Token holders can stake DIR and receive rewards. To stake DIR you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending DIR to each candidates specific Masternode-address using the official governance dapp  "DeFiMaster" The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes.

Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 96 epochs / 8,640 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the un-Masternode.

Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees. Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards.


#### What are the voters incentives? Do voters get rewards too?
Token voters should vote for the candidates who demonstrate strong support to the Diora ecosystem.
If strong candidates are voted to become masternodes, the network will be more powerful and the voters will earn more rewards.
